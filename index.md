# SMRT-SV

Structural variant (SV) and indel caller for PacBio reads based on methods from
[Chaisson et
al. 2014](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature13907.html).

### Data

Whole genome sequences, structural variants, and Sanger sequences from variant validations are available through the [BioProject PRJNA335618](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA335618).

Small indels are available here for [CHM1](data/indels/CHM1_indels.vcf.gz) and [CHM13](data/indels/CHM13_indels.vcf.gz).

## Installation

SMRT-SV requires git, Python (2.6.6 or later) and Perl (5.10.1 or later) for
installation.

SMRT-SV has been tested on CentOS 6.8 and should work with most Linux-style
distributions.

### Get the code

Clone the repository into your desired installation directory and build SMRT-SV
dependencies.

```bash
mkdir /usr/local/smrtsv
cd /usr/local/smrtsv
git clone --recursive git@github.com:EichlerLab/pacbio_variant_caller.git .
make
```

Note that some dependencies (e.g., RepeatMasker) require hardcoded paths to this
installation directory. If you need to move SMRT-SV to another directory, it is
easier to change to that directory, clone the repository, and rebuild the
dependencies there.

### Test installation

Add the installation directory to your path.

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/smrtsv/bin:$PATH
```

Print SMRT-SV help to confirm installation.

```bash
smrtsv.py --help
```

Alternately, run `smrtsv.py` directly from the installation directory.

```bash
/usr/local/smrtsv/bin/smrtsv.py --help
```

## Configure distributed environment

SMRT-SV uses DRMAA to submit jobs to a grid-engine-style cluster. To enable the `--distribute` option of SMRT SV, add the following line to your `.bash_profile` with the correct path to the DRMAA library for your cluster.

```bash
export DRMAA_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/uge/lib/lx-amd64/libdrmaa.so.1.0
```

Alternately, provide the path to your DRMAA library with the SMRT-SV
`--drmaalib` option.

Additionally, you may need to configure resource requirements depending on your
cluster and PacBio data. Use the `--cluster_config` option when running SMRT-SV
to pass a JSON file that specifies [Snakemake-style cluster
parameters](https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/wiki/Documentation#markdown-header-cluster-configuration). An
example configuration used to run SMRT-SV with human genomes on the Eichler lab
cluster is provided in this repository in the file `cluster.eichler.json`.

## Tutorial

The following tutorial shows how to call structural variants and indels in
yeast.

### Download PacBio reads

Note that this data set requires ~33 GB of disk space for the reads and another
~30 GB for the read alignments.

```bash
# List of AWS-hosted files from PacBio including raw reads and an HGAP assembly.
wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/pb-jchin/6359919/raw/9c172c7ff7cbc0193ce89e715215ce912f3f30e6/gistfile1.txt

# Keep only .xml, .bas.h5, and .bax.h5 files.
sed '/fasta/d;/fastq/d;/celera/d;/HGAP/d' gistfile1.txt > gistfile1.keep.txt

# Download data into a raw reads directory.
mkdir -p raw_reads
cd raw_reads
for f in `cat ../gistfile1.keep.txt`; do wget --force-directories $f; done

# Create a list of reads for analysis.
cd ..
find ./raw_reads -name "*.bax.h5" -exec readlink -f {} \; > reads.fofn
```

### Prepare the reference assembly

Download the reference assembly (sacCer3) from UCSC.

```bash
mkdir -p reference
cd reference
wget ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/sacCer3/bigZips/chromFa.tar.gz
```

Unpack the reference tarball and concatenate individual chromosome files into a
single reference FASTA file.

```bash
tar zxvf chromFa.tar.gz
cat *.fa > sacCer3.fasta
rm -f *.fa *.gz
cd ..
```

Prepare the reference sequence for alignment with PacBio reads. This step
produces suffix array and ctab files used by BLASR to speed up alignments.

```bash
smrtsv.py index reference/sacCer3.fasta
```

### Align reads to the reference

Align reads to the reference with BLASR.

```bash
smrtsv.py align reference/sacCer3.fasta reads.fofn
```

### Find signatures of variants in raw reads

Find candidate regions to search for SVs based on SV signatures.

```bash
smrtsv.py detect reference/sacCer3.fasta alignments.fofn candidates.bed
```

### Assemble regions

Assemble local regions of the genome that have SV signatures or tile across the
genome.

```bash
smrtsv.py assemble reference/sacCer3.fasta reads.fofn alignments.fofn candidates.bed local_assembly_alignments.bam
```

### Call variants

Call variants by aligning tiled local assemblies back to the
reference. Optionally, specify the sample name for annotation of the final VCF
file and a species name (common or scientific as supported by
[RepeatMasker](http://www.repeatmasker.org/)) for repeat masking of structural
variants.

```bash
smrtsv.py call reference/sacCer3.fasta alignments.fofn local_assembly_alignments.bam variants.vcf --sample UCSF_Yeast9464 --species yeast
```
